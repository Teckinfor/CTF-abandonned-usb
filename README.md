# Abandonned-Usb
Small CTF that mixes programming, binary and crypto. Beginner/advanced level !

The only thing you know is that you found an abandoned USB stick on the street. 
Like a pro, you opened it in a sandbox, and you only discovered this file. 
Are you able to find all the information?

(For sure you are ^^)
